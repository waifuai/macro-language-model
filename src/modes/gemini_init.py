Gemini mode initialization utilities for the Waifu Chatbot application.

This module provides initialization functions for the Gemini conversation mode,
handling the setup and configuration of waifu chatbot instances. It serves as
an entry point for initializing the conversation system with proper configuration
and debug settings.

Key features:
- Waifu chatbot initialization with configuration
- Debug mode support for development and troubleshooting
- Integration with the WaifuChatbot class for conversation management
- Centralized initialization logic for Gemini mode

Note: This module appears to reference a WaifuChatbot class that may not be
implemented in the current codebase, suggesting it may be part of an incomplete
or planned feature implementation.
